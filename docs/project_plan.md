# Project Plan

This project is a JavaFX demo, progressing from simple to advanced JavaFX examples and features.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
- [x] Choose Java version (e.g., Java 17, Java 21)
- [x] Set up build tool (Gradle or Maven)
- [x] Configure IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse)
- [x] Initialize Git repository and .gitignore
- [x] Create base project structure (src, tests, docs, etc.)

### Phase 2: Simple JavaFX Demo (basic window, controls)
- [x] Create main application class
- [x] Implement basic window (Stage, Scene)
- [x] Add simple controls (Button, Label, TextField)
- [x] Handle basic events (button click, text input)
- [x] Provide runnable example and documentation

### Phase 3: Intermediate JavaFX (layouts, events, styling)
- [x] Use layout managers (VBox, HBox, GridPane)
- [x] Add menu bar and toolbars
- [x] Implement event handling for multiple controls
- [x] Apply CSS styling to UI components
- [x] Document intermediate features and solutions

### Phase 4: Advanced JavaFX (custom components, animations, data binding)
- [x] Create custom UI components
- [x] Implement animations and transitions
- [x] Use data binding for dynamic updates
- [x] Integrate external libraries (e.g., ControlsFX)
- [x] Provide advanced example and documentation

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] Set up unit testing framework (JUnit)
- [x] Write tests for UI logic
- [x] Automate tests with CI/CD
- [x] Perform code reviews and static analysis
- [x] Document QA process and solutions

### Phase 6: Documentation and Examples
- [x] Write user guide and API documentation
- [x] Add code comments and docstrings
- [x] Create example projects for each feature
- [x] Maintain CHANGELOG and workflow docs
- [x] Provide contribution guidelines

### Phase 7: Deployment and Release
- [ ] Package application (JAR, native installer)
- [ ] Test deployment on multiple platforms
- [ ] Automate release process with scripts
- [ ] Update documentation for deployment
- [ ] Announce release and gather feedback

### Phase 8: Maintenance and Community Support
- [x] Monitor issues and bug reports
- [x] Update dependencies and tooling
- [x] Respond to community questions
- [x] Plan future enhancements
- [x] Document maintenance procedures

## Tasks

- [x] Organize code into logical directories
- [x] Modernize codebase
- [x] Add documentation
- [x] Set up CI/CD workflows
- [x] Add supporting files and automation
- [x] Implement simple JavaFX demo
- [x] Add intermediate JavaFX features
- [x] Add advanced JavaFX features

## Milestones
